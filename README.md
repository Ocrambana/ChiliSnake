# ChiliSnake
My implementation of classic snake using [Chili's framework](https://github.com/planetchili/chili_framework).

If you want to try this game you can download it in a zip file [HERE](https://mega.nz/#!OJxUlC4Z!98nsugZJt_TAi99kq5qs3nuJ2bsvQzKY0orm_tEwMIk).

The controls are:
  * Arrow keys to move
  * Enter to start
  * Eat the red square, avoid the grey ones
  * CTRL or R to Restart the game after Game Over
  
Enjoy :)
